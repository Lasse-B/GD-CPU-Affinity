# GD-CPU-Affinity
Sets CPU affinity for the game Grim Dawn to every other CPU thread in an attempt to lessen the clogging on the first CPU core

- run GD CPU Affinity
- run the game
- watch your CPU load
- wait for about five seconds for the changes to CPU affinity to be applied

You can put GD CPU Affinity into your startup folder to be run automatically on system startup. Whenever it detects a new Grim Dawn session it automatically applies the affinity settings.
